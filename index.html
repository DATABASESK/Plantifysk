          My one and only gadhuuuu to be honest I never know that I would fall in love with someone beautiful like you but it is true that I am in love with you and you have been the most beautiful thing that would have been ever happen to me literally the best thing ever. You are so much precious to me that my words are not enough to express it your smile is the cutest thing I have seen the best and it just makes my day whenever i see your smile. My day starts with you my day ends with you and as soon as I talk to you even if I am in a bad mood it instantly changes my mood. In some relationship as I have seen people loose there complete identity people changes everything but ik ours is not the same we both accept each other with all the flaws we have and the good deeds too. We are the best in the world we are the best together we help each other to grow just awesome broo.
